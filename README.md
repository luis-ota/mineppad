# MinePPad

MinePPad is a Minecraft remake created in Notepad using Python and the Ursina library.

## How to Play

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Run `python main.py`

If you already have Ursina installed, uninstall it, as the `main.py` script will automatically install it.

---
*Note: Ursina 4.0 is required; versions above this won't work.*
